# Document Comparison Tool Roadmap

This roadmap outlines five powerful features planned for future development to enhance the functionality and user experience of the Document Comparison Tool. These features aim to make the tool more robust, versatile, and user-friendly while maintaining its privacy-first approach.

## 1. Advanced OCR Integration for Scanned Documents
   - **Description**: Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities using a library like Tesseract.js to extract text from scanned PDFs and images, enabling accurate comparisons for non-text-native documents.
   - **Impact**: Expands support for scanned documents, making the tool more versatile for users working with physical document scans or low-quality images.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add Tesseract.js via CDN for client-side OCR processing.
     - Implement preprocessing for image-based PDFs and images to improve text extraction accuracy.
     - Update the `extractFileContent` function to handle OCR results seamlessly.
   - **Estimated Timeline**: Q3 2025
   - **Priority**: High

## 2. Real-Time Collaboration Mode
   - **Description**: Enable real-time collaboration by integrating WebRTC or a similar technology, allowing multiple users to upload and compare documents simultaneously with live diff updates.
   - **Impact**: Facilitates team-based document reviews, ideal for collaborative editing or legal document analysis, while maintaining local processing for privacy.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication without server-side storage.
     - Add a "Share Session" feature to generate temporary links for collaborators.
     - Update the UI to reflect real-time changes in the comparison view.
   - **Estimated Timeline**: Q4 2025
   - **Priority**: Medium

## 3. Semantic Comparison with NLP
   - **Description**: Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) using a lightweight, client-side NLP library (e.g., compromise.js) to compare documents based on semantic meaning rather than just literal text differences.
   - **Impact**: Improves comparison accuracy by identifying paraphrased content or synonymous phrases, especially useful for legal or academic documents.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Integrate a client-side NLP library for semantic analysis.
     - Develop a new "Semantic Diff" algorithm option in the comparison settings.
     - Enhance the results display to highlight semantic similarities and differences.
   - **Estimated Timeline**: Q1 2026
   - **Priority**: High

## 4. Version History and Diff Tracking
   - **Description**: Add a version history feature that allows users to save and compare multiple versions of a document locally in the browser's IndexedDB, with a visual timeline of changes.
   - **Impact**: Simplifies tracking document evolution over time, especially for iterative editing processes, without compromising privacy.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement IndexedDB storage for local version history.
     - Create a timeline UI component to display saved document versions.
     - Add functionality to compare any two versions from the history.
   - **Estimated Timeline**: Q2 2026
   - **Priority**: Medium

## 5. Customizable Output Formats for Reports
   - **Description**: Enhance the report generation feature to support multiple output formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, Markdown) with customizable templates for professional reporting.
   - **Impact**: Provides users with flexible, polished report options for sharing or archiving comparison results, improving usability for professional settings.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Integrate a client-side PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF) for PDF reports.
     - Develop customizable report templates with user-defined fields (e.g., title, logo, comments).
     - Update the `generateReport` function to support multiple output formats.
   - **Estimated Timeline**: Q3 2026
   - **Priority**: Low

## Notes
- All features will maintain the tool's privacy-first approach, ensuring no data is sent to external servers.
- Development priorities may shift based on user feedback and community contributions.
- Each feature will be thoroughly tested for compatibility with existing functionality and performance in modern browsers.
